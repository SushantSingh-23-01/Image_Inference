# SDXL Optimization Toolkit

This repository contains code and resources for optimizing Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) image generation models. The focus is on techniques to reduce the model size and computational cost without significant loss in quality.

## Key Features

* **SDXL Model Quantization:** Scripts and notebooks demonstrating various quantization techniques to reduce the memory footprint of full SDXL models.
    * using `llama.cpp` to GGUF format. 
* **LoRA Compression:** Tools and examples for compressing LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models. T
