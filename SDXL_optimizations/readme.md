# SDXL Optimization Toolkit

This repository contains code and resources for optimizing Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) image generation models. The focus is on techniques to reduce the model size and computational cost without significant loss in quality.

## Key Features

* **SDXL Model Quantization:** Scripts and notebooks for converting to lower quant gguf format using llama.cpp.
* **LoRA Compression:** Tools and examples for compressing LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models.
